Exercism YAMLScript Test Runner
===============================

The Docker image to automatically run tests on YAMLScript solutions submitted
to [Exercism].


## Run the test runner

To run the tests of an arbitrary exercise, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to
`<output-dir>/results.json`.


## Run the test runner on an exercise using Docker

_This script is provided for testing purposes, as it mimics how test runners
run in Exercism's production environment._

To run the tests of an arbitrary exercise using the Docker image, do the
following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to
`<output-dir>/results.json`.


## Run the tests

To run the tests to verify the behavior of the test runner, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-tests.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `results.json` generated by
running the current state of the code against the "known good"
`tests/<test-name>/results.json`.
All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden"
state, you'll need to update the affected
`tests/<test-name>/expected_results.json` file(s).

## Testing repository integrity

This repository has a Makefile for testing / linting various things.

You should run the `make test` command and ensure it finishes cleanly before
pushing commits.
